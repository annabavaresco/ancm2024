Advanced Neural and Cognitive Modelling 2024
===================================
This website contains the materials for the lab sessions of the couse Advanced Neural Cognitive Modelling 2024.

The TA for these labs is `Anna Bavaresco <https://annabavaresco.github.io/>`_. 
Please reach out to her if you have any questions related to the materials on this website.

.. note::
    The content of this website is largely based on materials 
    from the `2022 edition <https://clclab.github.io/ANCM/intro.html>`_ of the couse, 
    which were curated by `Marianne de Heer Kloots <https://mdhk.net/>`_ and 
    `Ashley Burgoyne <https://www.mcg.uva.nl/people/jaburgoyne/>`_.

Goals and Teching Principles Behind the Tutorials
+++++++++++++++

Trivial as it may sound, the tutorials included in this course were created mainly for you to **learn**.
This means that you should ideally experience the notebooks as challenging but not overwhelming. If,
for any reason, you find the contents too easy or too hard, feel free to politely point this out to 
the TA(s) and they will do their best to adjust the course materials based on your learning needs and goals.

+++++++++++++++
Questions you may have about the assignments/tutorials
+++++++++++++++

**Can I work on the notebooks together with coursemates?**
Assignments are submitted and graded individually. However, it is known that peer learning can significantly
improve the learning experience for students. If you find yourself stuck on a topic/notebook and you feel
that working on it with a coursemate might help you learn, you are absolutely welcome to do so. Remember, however,
that the goal should always be for you to **learn** contents, not to passively copy a solution that
your coursemate came up with. 

**Can I use ChatGPT to help me with the notebooks?**
Similar to the previous question, the answer is, it depends. If you are looking for a shortcut to submit
the best possible report with the minimum effort, the answer is no. If, on the other hand, you are stuck on 
something and too shy to reach out to coursemates and TA(s), then using ChatGPT to get more clarity on a
topic/question is perfectly acceptable. Again, remember that simply copy-pasting something ChatGPT-generated
is not acceptable and won't probably teach you anything. Using ChatGPT to improve the style of your 
report is also discouraged: if you don't try to work on your writing style yourself, it's never going to improve!

**I have an offline question about the tutorials. Should I contact the TA right away?**
The TA(s) are there to help you and do their best to answer your questions. However, they are unfortunately human beings
with limited time and resources. This means that, if they get too many emails/requests, they will inevitably
be slow in responding. If you have a question about the tutorials, it may be good to check with your coursemates
if the information wasn't communicated clearly or if you accidentally missed it. This way, TAs will deal 
with a reduced number of requests and will, hopefully, be able to respond more promptly to the truly unclear/urgent issues.

Note that different rules apply for questions that arise during the lab hours. In that case, the TA is directly
available to answer your questions, and you are more than welcome to ask them in person.

**Due to unforeseeable circumstances, I will be unable to submit the assignment(s) within the deadline. What should I do?**
Contact the TA or the course coordinator. If you have good reasons for being unable to submit the assignment,
they will most likely understand and do their best to find a solution that is suitable for you.
